# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a single-module Java 25 Spring Boot application built with Maven. Production code lives under `src/main/java/com/svi/messaging/` and is organized by feature. Keep WhatsApp HTTP, orchestration, Meta integration, DTOs, models, security, and configuration under `whatsapp/`. Keep the channel-neutral AI boundary and adapters under `ai/`; that package must not depend on WhatsApp. Put only genuinely cross-feature types under `common/`. Tests mirror the main package tree, with shared test factories under `com.svi.messaging.support` and webhook fixtures in `src/test/resources/fixtures/whatsapp/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use the checked-in Maven wrapper so contributors share the same Maven version.

- `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local` (Windows: `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run "-Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local"`) starts the local in-memory service.
- `./mvnw test` runs the JUnit test suite and Spring context checks.
- `./mvnw clean verify` performs a clean compilation and all verification steps.
- `./mvnw package` creates the executable JAR in `target/`.

Run commands from the repository root. Do not commit generated `target/` content.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow standard Java naming: `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces, `camelCase` for methods and variables, and uppercase snake case for constants. Retain the root package `com.svi.messaging` and place new channel connectors directly beneath it without a `features` wrapper. Match the existing Spring-generated style: tabs for indentation, opening braces on the declaration line, and one public top-level type per file. Prefer constructor injection for Spring dependencies and small classes with a single responsibility. No formatter or linter is currently configured; use IDE formatting and remove unused imports before committing.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests use JUnit Jupiter, Mockito, MockMvc, and mocked HTTP boundaries. Name test classes with the `Tests` suffix and methods for behavior, for example `rejectsInvalidWebhookSignature()`. Add focused tests for services, clients, mappers, concurrency, and signature validation; reserve `@SpringBootTest` for application wiring. Tests must not need real Meta or OpenAI credentials.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

The short history does not establish a formal convention. Use concise, imperative subjects such as `Add webhook signature validation` and keep commits focused. Pull requests should explain the change, list verification commands, link relevant issues, and call out configuration or API-contract changes. Include sample requests or responses when endpoint behavior changes.

## Security & Configuration

Never commit access tokens, webhook secrets, customer phone numbers, message bodies, or private API URLs. Supply secrets through environment variables; `.env.example` is an inventory and is not loaded automatically. The nondurable dispatcher must remain limited to `local` and `test`; production requires a durable implementation.

The outbound REST endpoint must also remain limited to `local` and `test`. It requires bearer authentication, recipient/template allowlists, and an `Idempotency-Key`. Preserve the distinction between Meta accepting a submission and confirming delivery through a later webhook. The process-local outbound idempotency store is bounded and nondurable; do not enable it as a production delivery mechanism.
